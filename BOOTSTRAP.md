# Bootstrap a new repo from this template

One-time checklist. ~5 minutes. Per `~/.claude/rules/greptile-pr-gate.md`.

## 1. Repo creation

- [ ] Click **Use this template** → create the new repo under `tokoyo-labs/<name>` (or appropriate org).
- [ ] Clone locally: `git clone git@github.com:tokoyo-labs/<name>.git && cd <name>`.

## 2. Replace template-isms

- [ ] Edit `README.md` — replace template description with project description.
- [ ] Edit `CODEOWNERS` — adjust ownership if not @sltbrta.
- [ ] Edit `docs/ROADMAP.md` — initialize Track A + first deliverables.
- [ ] Edit `LICENSE` — if not MIT, replace with appropriate license.
- [ ] Edit `.coderabbit.yaml` — adjust `language` or `path_filters` per project if needed.
- [ ] Edit `package.json` — replace `REPLACE-ME-AT-BOOTSTRAP` and set the package manager pin if not using Bun.

## 3. Install GitHub apps (one-time per repo)

- [ ] **CodeRabbit** — https://github.com/apps/coderabbitai — install on the new repo.
- [ ] **Greptile** — https://github.com/apps/greptile — install on the new repo. In Greptile dashboard → enable **"Create GitHub status check"** for this repo.
- [ ] **GitHub Copilot Code Review** — already enabled at org level; verify `Settings → Code review → Copilot code review` shows the repo opted-in.

## 4. Initial PR to populate status check names

Branch protection cannot reference status checks that have never run on the repo (GitHub returns `Invalid integration ids`). So:

- [ ] Create a trivial first PR (e.g., update this README with project description) as DRAFT.
- [ ] Mark ready for review: `gh pr ready 1`.
- [ ] Wait for CR + Greptile + Copilot to each post their status check (~5-10 minutes).
- [ ] Confirm with `gh pr checks 1` that 3 bot checks appear: `CodeRabbit`, `Greptile Review`, `Copilot Pull Request Reviewer`.

## 5. Branch protection / Ruleset

Per `~/.claude/rules/greptile-pr-gate.md` § "Set GitHub Ruleset for `main`":

- [ ] Go to **Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New ruleset**.
- [ ] Name: `Merge Checks`. Enforcement: **Active**. Bypass list: **empty**.
- [ ] Target branches: `Add target → Include default branch`.
- [ ] Branch rules — CHECK:
  - ✅ Restrict deletions
  - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
    - Required approvals: 1
    - Dismiss stale approvals on new commits
    - Require conversation resolution before merging
  - ✅ Require status checks to pass
    - Require branches to be up to date before merging
    - Add: `CodeRabbit`, `Greptile Review`, `Copilot Pull Request Reviewer`, + any CI workflow names (e.g., `file-size-gate`)
  - ✅ Block force pushes
- [ ] LEAVE UNCHECKED:
  - ❌ Require code scanning results (no CodeQL installed by default)
  - ❌ Require linear history (preference — enable if you want squash-only)
  - ❌ Require signed commits (preference)
- [ ] Save the ruleset.

## 6. CI environment

The template ships three repo-local CI checks:

- `file-size-gate.yml` calls `scripts/check-file-size.sh`.
- `quality.yml` runs Python and TS/JS quality jobs when `pyproject.toml` or `package.json` exists.
- `codeowners-check.yml` validates CODEOWNERS when ownership files change.

Per-project setup:

- [ ] Add lockfiles (`uv.lock`, `bun.lockb`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, etc.) once dependencies are real.
- [ ] Add project-specific tests and coverage gates once source exists.
- [ ] Confirm actual CI status-check names after the first PR, then add them to the Ruleset.

## 7. First commit

- [ ] After bootstrap, commit any local edits to the template files.
- [ ] Push (will require PR — branch protection is now active).

## 8. Update dotclaude memory

Once bootstrap complete, add a per-project memory entry:

```
~/.claude/projects/-Users-sammy-Developer-<project>/memory/feedback_two_bot_gate_active.md
```

Note: date enabled, exact status-check names confirmed for this repo, any per-repo .coderabbit.yaml overrides.

## 9. Modularity gates

Per `~/.claude/rules/code-modularity-standards.md`, the file cap is wired in two places:

- `.github/workflows/file-size-gate.yml` runs on PRs and pushes to `main`.
- `scripts/check-file-size.sh` is the single source of truth and can be run locally.
- `.file-size-allow-list` records justified exceptions only.

Run `bash scripts/check-file-size.sh` before the first PR and add no exceptions unless the rule allows them.

## 10. Quality toolchain

Per `~/.claude/rules/quality-toolchain-pre-merge.md`, the template includes Layer 1 and Layer 3 scaffolding:

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for local ruff/Biome hooks.
- `pyproject.toml` for ruff, mypy, bandit, and pytest defaults.
- `biome.json` and `tsconfig.base.json` for TS/JS lint, format, and strict TS.
- `.github/workflows/quality.yml` for CI.

After clone, run `./scripts/setup-hooks.sh` and `pre-commit install` if the project uses pre-commit.

## 11. 3-bot PR review

Per `~/.claude/rules/greptile-pr-gate.md`, use CodeRabbit, Greptile, and Copilot as the ready-state review set. Open work as draft first, perform internal review, then mark ready. When ready, poll all three reviewer surfaces: inline comments, issue comments, and formal reviews. Apply or dismiss every finding with reasoning before merge.

## 12. Draft-first workflow

Every non-trivial PR opens as draft. Run a subagent or CLI review on the draft diff, fix findings, then `gh pr ready <num>` to trigger the bot pass. For parallel phases, follow `~/.claude/rules/parallel-phase-cadence.md`: move every PR in the wave through draft, internal review, ready, bot findings, and merge together. Do not advance one sibling ahead of the wave.

---

Done. New PRs follow the 3-layer model: pre-commit dispatch agent review → draft iteration → ready-for-review triggers both bot gates.
